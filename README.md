# EddiesInfoScreen
Eddies Information Screen or St Edmund's College Canberra Information Screen is a digital information screen that can be placed in reception or other areas of the College and is like an information system that you might see in airports, railway stations etc.

Setting the Information Screen up:

Software:

Instructions:
1) Open PHPMYADMIN
2) Create a new database
3) Import the MYSQL Database
4) change the database names etc. on the config files.
